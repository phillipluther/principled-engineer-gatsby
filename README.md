# A Personal Starter for Gatsby Blogs

I've abandonned more Gatsby blogs than I care to remember. I _do_ remember how much repetitive "not this, not this, add this, change this" there is with every single one of 'em, though. Everything from updating text in `gatsby-config` to setting up my preferred linting/prettier rules.

After the I-forgot-how-many-times-I've-done-this time, I got smart and created this -- a personal starter that I like for Gatsby. <-- Note that I _did NOT_ say that I like Gatsby.

## The Gist

This thing is seeded from `gatsby-starter-blog`. I cleaned up the config so it's generic for me, set up rules that I like, added tag support, and changed some of the components and basic layout.

From now on I'll just --

```
npx gatsby new my-new-project https://github.com/phillipluther/my-blank-blog-gatsby-starter
```
